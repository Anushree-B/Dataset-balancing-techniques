# Dataset-balancing-techniques
This Python repository provides implementations of various dataset balancing techniques (under sampling, oversampling, SMOTE) and functionalities for evaluating their effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets.

This repository provides implementations of various dataset balancing techniques commonly used to address imbalanced datasets in machine learning. It includes code for:

- Undersampling: Randomly removing data points from the majority class to match the size of the minority class.
- Oversampling: Duplicating data points from the minority class to increase its representation.
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique): Creates synthetic data points for the minority class based on existing data points.

For a more detailed explanation of imbalanced datasets and balancing techniques, refer to this article:

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding new balancing techniques, evaluation methods, or improvements to existing code.
